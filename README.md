# Semester 6 - Blind Date Project

A social media platform optimized for accessability and ease of use for visually impaired people.

This project focuses on HTML semantics (structure), accessiblity, and speed optimizations. Good looking CSS and animations are only a hinderance for screen-readers.

Here are some useful sources, that will help during development

# Requirements

## Development environment

This project was meant to run on a Linux enviroment. While we would like to be able to have a full compatibility between Windows and Linux, we do not think that it is feasible to achive in a easily transferable project form. For that reason we encourage the following groups to use [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on their Windows machines.

---

## WSL Setup

Setup steps are taken from the Microsoft Documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

First launch CMD with administrative priveleges and then run the following command.

```sh
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

This will install Ubuntu on your local machine.

After which you want to set it as your default WSL distro with the following command.

```sh
wsl --setdefault Ubuntu
```

You want to ensure that you are using WSL 2 instead of 1 (This is important), so run the following command

```sh
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
```

And with that you have properly installed Ubuntu on your Windows machine.

---

## Docker

For Docker you want to have Docker Desktop installed on your machine.

From there you want to go to Settings > General and enable `Use WSL 2 Engine`.

After that go to General > Resources > WSL Integrations and enable the integration for Ubuntu.

---

## Ubuntu Distro

You can access the WSL distro through either launching the Ubuntu terminal or typing `wsl` into CMD

There will be 3 main packages you need to install

- NVM - Node version manager
- Yarn - essentially npm but better
- Krakend - Api gateway

To install them run the following commands

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Install Nvm

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 18
nvm alias default 18
```

Install Yarn

```
npm install --global yarn
```

Lastly to install Krakend you need to run the following command as a sudo user.

```
sudo su
```

```
apt install -y ca-certificates gnupg
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 5DE6FD698AD6FDD2
echo "deb https://repo.krakend.io/apt stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/krakend.list
apt-get update
apt-get install -y krakend
```

This is the easiest way to install the gateway and use it locally. The download link is here if you wish to use a docker container instead. https://www.krakend.io/download/#

# Project Related Information

## Installing the Project

To install clone the repo and run

```
yarn install && yarn build
```

---

## Running the Project

To run the project you have 3 options available

- Locally (Best for development)
- Docker compose
- Kubernetes

### Running it Locally

The easiest way to run the project is to open a split terminal in VSCode

![Split Screen Terminal](resources/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

And running all the microservices and front-end from `./apps` with:

```
yarn dev
```

And running the Krakend API Gateway with:

```
yarn proxy
```

---

### Running it on Docker

To run the project on Docker simply run:

```
docker compose up
```

---

### Running it on Kubernetes

# Repository structure

The repository is comprised of NodeJS applications, making the whole repository entirely javascript-based.

## Turborepo

It utilizes Turborepo, a high-performance build system for Javascript and Typescript projects. Turborepo allows for cached builds and dependecy sharing between applications, as well as local packages that do not require versioning and/or publishing to npm to use.

> Local packages can be found in the `./packages` directory.

### Structure

    .

## Techstack

- Front-end - NextJS
- Authentication - Auth0
- Gateway - Krakend
- Microservices - ExpressJS
- ORM - Prisma
- Database - MongoDB

<br>

# Enviroment Variables

## MongoDB

```
DATABASE_URL
```

DATABASE_URL can be found on the [MongoDB official site](https://www.mongodb.com/). After registering and creating a database navigate to _Connect_ and you will be provided a connection string for your database. Use that value here.

## Auth0

```
AUTH0_SECRET
AUTH0_BASE_URL
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
```

These values can be found after making an Auth0 account and creating a _Regular Web Application_ with the NextJS template. After you have created your application you can find the application specific config [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/interactive).

## Client-side accessible URL's

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY
```

These two consist of the URLs for the front-end application and API Gateway, both of which need to be accessible on the client side of the NextJS application. Both of these run on the default ports locally, NextJS at localhost:3000 and Krakend at localhost:8080.

> Important! All variables used in the front-end should be routed through env.mjs file.
> Do NOT use proccess.env.VARIABLE directly. The env.mjs ensures that sensitive variables aren't exposed to the client, variables are linted, and that no variables are missing.

## AWS Bucket

```
S3_BUCKET_NAME
S3_BUCKET_REGION
S3_ACCESS_KEY
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

These variables are responsible for making file uploads possible to the AWS bucket. They can be found in the settings after creating an S3 Bucket in AWS.

<br>

# Authentication

The authentication process happens as follows in this diagram.

![Auth Diagram](/resources/AuthenticationDiagram.png)

After logging in, the application can then request an ID and access token, which are put in each request's Authrization header with the value 'Bearer <_token_>'. After which the Gateway checks the validity of the token with Auth0. If the token is valid then the request is forwarded to the microservices.

## Settings up Auth0

### NextJS

The NextJS setup can be found [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/interactive). All settings and variables can be found in the [Auth0 website](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard) under Dashboard > Applications > Applications

### Krakend Gateway

The Krakend Gateway setup can be found [here](https://www.krakend.io/docs/authorization/auth0/). All settings and variables can be found in the [Auth0 website](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard) under Dashboard > Applications > APIs
